\## Domain

Logistics \& Supply Chain



\## Problem Statement

Create a system to track shipments across supply chain stages.  

Each shipment should have:

\- A unique ID

\- Current status

\- History of updates



\## Learning Goals

\- Understand object-oriented programming (OOP)

\- Work with multiple classes (`Shipment`, `Tracker`)

\- Implement history tracking with timestamps

\- Practice file handling \& reporting

\- Handle custom exceptions



\## Tasks for Students

1\. Implement the \*\*Shipment class\*\* (ID, status, history).

2\. Implement the \*\*Tracker class\*\* (manage multiple shipments).

3\. Build a menu in `main.py` to:

&nbsp;  - Add shipments

&nbsp;  - Update statuses

&nbsp;  - View history

&nbsp;  - Generate reports

4\. Use `utils.py` for ID generation.

5\. Add error handling with custom exceptions.



\## Extended Scope : If students are able to complete then they can write the other below:

\- Export reports to a file (`report.py`)

\- Load and save data in JSON format

\- Validate status (only allow: "Created", "Dispatched", "In Transit", "Delivered")
